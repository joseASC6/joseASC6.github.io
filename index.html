                I am a high school student at Lawrence High School, New York. My biggest passions are programming and sports. When I am not out playing a sport or inside hacking away at my computer, I love to go out and spend time with family and my friends. I also have a huge interest in debating, politics, business and stocks and any sort of technology. My current goal is to use my coding skills as a tool to help me create a pathway into a career in either programming or business. If you ever need someone that is hard-working, dedicated and good at critical thinking don't hesitate to reach out to me.
