        <h2>As a kid, I quickly latched on to sports as a way to bring myself closer to new friends and my family. But it later became more than just a hobby but a mindset. Pushing myself when I want to give up is the definition of my work ethic.  Sports not only gave me the discipline for a future career but it showed me how to learn from my mistakes. Whether it's in a classroom or on the field, staying late and working on my craft makes me love what I do even more. I live for the feeling of my body and mind go through hell because I know it's the feeling of improvement and success.
