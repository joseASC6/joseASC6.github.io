        <h2>As a kid, I quickly latched on to sports as a way to bring myself closer to new friends and my family. But it later became more than just a hobby but a mindset. Pushing myself when I want to give up is the definition of my work ethic.  Sports not only gave me the discipline for a future career but it showed me how to learn from my mistakes. Whether it's in a classroom or on the field, staying late and working on my craft makes me love what I do even more. I live for the feeling of my body and mind go through hell because I know it's the feeling of improvement and success.

    <h2>Running has always been a big passion of mine. I don't only run to keep my body in shape but my mental health in shape. Running has always been a way to clear my mind and up lift myself. I run the 400, 800 and many other long distance events.</h2>

    <h2>Wrestling is one of the most physically challenging things I have gone through. It has taught me how to discipline myself to the extreme. I wrestle Varsity at 126Lbs and also 132Lbs.</h2>
